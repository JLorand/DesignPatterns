#Design Patterns
Design patterns are solutions to software design problems you find again and again in real-world application development. Patterns are about reusable designs and interactions of objects.

##Categories
* _Creational_
* _Structural_
* _Behavioral_

***

##Creational Patterns
* _Abstract Factory_ - Creates an instance of several families of classes
* _Builder_ - Separates object construction from its representation
* _Factory Method_ - Creates an instance of several derived classes
* _Prototype_ - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
* _Singleton_ - A class of which only a single instance can exist

***

##Structural Patterns
* _Adapter_ - Match interfaces of different classes
* _Bridge_ - Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
* _Composite_ - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
* _Decorator_ - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
* _Facade_ - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
* _Flyweight_ - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
* _Proxy_ - An object representing another object

***

##Behavioral Patterns
* _Chain of Responsibility_ - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
* _Command_ - Encapsulate a command request as an object
* _Interpreter_ - A way to include language elements in a program
* _Iterator_ - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
* _Mediator_ - Defines simplified communication between classes
* _Memento_ - Capture and restore an object's internal state
* _Observer_ - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
* _State_ - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
* _Strategy_ - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
* _Template Method_ - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
* _Visitor_ - Defines a new operation to a class without change
